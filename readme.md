# Extraction of NSW Property Data

**Date**: 24/04/2023

**Author**: Joseph Cheng

**Programming Language**: Python3.8 and above

## Disclaimer
- This is a personal, non-profit project that is intended for the public to access datasets, which can potentially help people make decisions when analysing on the property market.
- If the owner / government of this data source requires me to take down this project I will take it down immediately.

## Main Objective
- Property data is difficult to gather through these days. Luckily in New South Wales - Australia, the NSW State Government has provided public dataset of the transactional property sales data (See link below)
- The objective is to create a clean / comprehenable dataset with historical information of the property information in NSW Australia, based on the raw data provided by the government
- Please reach out to me to provide any feedbacks / improvements and I will try my best to update the dataset as soon as possible

## Personal Remarks
- I am also a first home buyer looking for optimisation to find opportunites in the property market. I hope that by sharing this code repository more people can access to property data and help them find their dream home easier. 

## How to Run
- Download the data from "NSW data source"
- unzip all the folders and save them in the appropriate location (TODO)
- pip install all the required python library
- run the main file
